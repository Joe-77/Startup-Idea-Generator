1. What excites you most about using AI in development?
   
   Answer => AI helps me move from idea to execution faster, saves time on repetitive tasks, and opens the door to creative, out-of-the-box solutions. It feels like working with a smart coding partner who enhances my workflow.

2. How do you keep your code clean, collaborative, and readable?

   Answer => I follow clear and consistent naming conventions, break logic into small reusable components, and add comments where necessary. I also use Git with meaningful commit messages to ensure the code is easy to understand and contribute to.

3. If your codebase was a song, what genre would it be — and why?

   Answer => Definitely Lo-fi chill beats — smooth, structured, and relaxed but still creative. It reflects the way I write code: clean, minimal, and easy to vibe with.
